# Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, a school dataset, and an image resource. The project focuses on analyzing school-related data and performing data analysis.

## File Structure

1. **schoolbus.jpg**  
   - An image resource.

2. **notebook.ipynb**  
   - A Jupyter Notebook containing the core code and analysis for the school dataset.

3. **schools.csv**  
   - A CSV file containing school-related data, which serves as the primary data source for analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the notebook and reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy

You can install required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook server:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `notebook.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface and run the cells step by step.

### Data Source
- The `schools.csv` file contains school data for analysis. Details of the structure and insights will be explored within the notebook.

## Usage
This project can be used for:
- Analyzing school data for patterns or trends.
- Practicing data analysis and visualization techniques.
- Developing skills in working with Jupyter Notebooks and pandas.

## License
This project is open-source. Feel free to modify and use the contents for your learning and analysis.
